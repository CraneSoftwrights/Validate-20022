  This entity technique builds an entity declaration from the contents
  of a system file, and then invokes the declaration for an XML file to
  leverage in an attribute definition and text. A direct reference to
  a SYSTEM identifier in an attribute value is not allowed in XML syntax.
  And these declarations cannot be used in an internal declaration subset
  in an XML file, only in an external declaration subset file.
